## Programming

### Learning Path

If youâ€™ve grokked the following resources, you should be able to work on the Shotcaller codebase with ease.

#### Essentials
- https://sokoban.iolivia.me/
- https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/

#### Extended
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ (no need to fully grasp it)
  - https://tourofrust.com
  - https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/readme.html
  - https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
- https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_0.html
- https://specs.amethyst.rs/docs/tutorials/01_intro.html

#### Optional

- https://kyren.github.io/2018/09/14/rustconf-talk.html
- https://www.jojolepro.com/blog/2020-08-20_event_chaining/
- https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html

### Tech Stack

#### Bracket-lib

https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib

For a text-based game, Rust gives us agency over the entire stack, all the way down to terminal libs like Crossterm. By intentionally constraining ourselves to ASCII/tiles graphics for the first iterations of the game we maintain a narrow focus on game mechanics. 

#### Specs

https://github.com/amethyst/specs

Specs isn't the hottest ECS around in Rust-world, but it's by far the most mature and well understood. We might very well migrate to something like Legion in the future, but right now Specs is perfectly adequate for our needs, and it also comes with outstanding learning resources (see Learning Path below).

#### Why not Amethyst Engine?

[Amethyst Engine](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) is too heavyweight for our immediate needs. It is also in a state of flux at the moment. Once Amethyst Engine has stabilized (1year+) we will certainly evaluate the merits of migrating to it.
